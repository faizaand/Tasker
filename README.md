Tasker is being built for the PA 2019 High School State Computer Fair. This is the second iteration, after winning the regional competition in early March. I plan to take it to the Play Store in the summer of 2019.

## Code Walkthrough
The project is buiit on the Ionic Framework, which is a framework that facilitates the ability of web developers to use traditional tools - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript - to build mobile applications. I had originally used React Native in the first iteration; however, this proved to be costly due to its high learning curve and low developer velocity. Ionic is appealing because of its use of Angular,a library built by Google to ...
