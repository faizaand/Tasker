# Tasker
Tasker is a task manager, geared towards humans. It aims to address one of the largest barriers to consistent productivity: setting 
priorities. How? It calculates a simple **aggregate task score**, which takes into account things like due date, urgency, difficulty,
your mood, and how much time you have to work, and it uses these scores to automatically build **work sessions**. Work sessions are guided
periods of intense focus and productivity, with built-in breaks, so that you can maximize your efficiency. And better yet, Tasker learns 
over time using simple regression analysis, so it will get better at scheduling breaks according to your needs.
